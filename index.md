# A Collection of Examples
{: .fs-9 }

Since 2011 I've been collecting, creating, and sharing examples for how to approach and or solve problems with TouchDesigner.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Getting started
I've tried all sorts of different mechanics for sharing and writing about these discoveries, and this time around I'm hoping to land on something a little more friendly and extensible. Something that keeps all the examples out of a `TOE` file and out of a folder with all manner of `TOX` files. 

## Start Exploring the Examples
